# Detection in Crowded Scenes: One Proposal, Multiple Predictions

A pytorch implementation is available on https://github.com/Purkialo/CrowdDet now.

This is the MegEngine implementation of our paper "[Detection in Crowded Scenes: One Proposal, Multiple Predictions](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Chu_Detection_in_Crowded_Scenes_One_Proposal_Multiple_Predictions_CVPR_2020_paper.html)", https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09163, published in CVPR 2020.

Our method aiming at detecting highly-overlapped instances in crowded scenes. 

The key of our approach is to let each proposal predict a set of instances that might be highly overlapped rather than a single one in previous proposal-based frameworks. With this scheme, the predictions of nearby proposals are expected to infer the **same set** of instances, rather than **distinguishing individuals**, which is much easy to be learned. Equipped with new techniques such as EMD Loss and Set NMS, our detector can effectively handle the difficulty of detecting highly overlapped objects.

# Run
1. Requirements:
    * python3.6.9, MegEngine 0.3.1, cuda10.0

2. CrowdHuman data:
    * CrowdHuman is a benchmark dataset to better evaluate detectors in crowd scenarios. The dataset can be downloaded from http://www.crowdhuman.org/. The path of the dataset is set in `config.py`.

3. Compile gpu_nms libraryï¼š
	```
	cd lib/layers
	sh ./setup.sh
	```
	* Please note that in some environments you may need to modify setup.sh!

4. Inference (GPU required):
	```
	cd model/emd_simple
	python3 inference.py -r path/to/meg_emd_simple.pkl -i ../../assets/running_1.jpg
	```
	you will get `result.jpg` like this
	<img width=60% src="assets/result_1.jpg"/>

5. Steps to train and test:
    * Step1:  training. More training and testing settings can be set in `config.py`.
	```
	python3 train.py
	```
    
	* Step2:  testing. If you have multiple GPUs, you can use ` -d 2 ` to use more GPUs.
	```
	python3 test.py -r 30
	```
    
	* Step3:  evaluating.
	```
	python3 .evaluate/compute_APMR.py --detfile ./model/crowd_emd_simple/outputs/eval_dump/dump-30.json --target_key 'box'
	python3 .evaluate/compute_JI.py --detfile ./model/crowd_emd_simple/outputs/eval_dump/dump-30.json --target_key 'box'
	```

# Models

We use pre-trained model from MegEngine ModelHub: https://data.megengine.org.cn/models/weights/resnet50_fbaug_76254_4e14b7d1.pkl. (or [resnet50_fbaug_76254_4e14b7d1.pkl](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ojiRJy3I-Xp8AzZRYLgdMQRsR-ETMXaT))

All models are based on ResNet-50 FPN.
